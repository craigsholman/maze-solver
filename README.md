Visual Studio solution for a maze solver

### Building solution HolmanMazeSolver
Open the solution in Visual Studio and build it.

### Running the MazeSolverTester console application
The MazeSolverTester is a console application that attempts to solve two-dimensional mazes.

A maze file is a text file that contains one or more rows of symbols.

Each of the rows in the text file should be of the same length.

The symbols used in the file are '#' for walls, '.' for open cells, 'A' for the start cell, and 'B' for a goal cell.

The full file pathname to be solved is specified on the command line. It is recommended to wrap the filepathname with double quotes.

If the program is to be run from Visual Studio, write the file pathname in the Command Line Arguments field of the Debug page of the project's Properties.
